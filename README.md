# flexOPT

flexOPT is implemented in Julia. The notebooks in `notebooks/` provide demos and exploratory workflows.

## Reproducible setup

Install Julia 1.12 with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup), clone this repository, and run this command from the clone:

```bash
julia scripts/install_notebook_kernel.jl
```

The installer:

- activates the cloned repository rather than a user-global Julia environment;
- instantiates the versions recorded in `Manifest.toml`;
- precompiles with one task to avoid IJulia precompile-task failures;
- installs a Jupyter kernel named **flexOPT 8 threads 1.12**;
- embeds the absolute path of that user’s clone in their local kernelspec.

After installation, reload VS Code, open a notebook, and choose **Select Kernel → Jupyter Kernel → flexOPT 8 threads 1.12**.

To choose another thread count, set `FLEXOPT_THREADS` while installing. For example:

```bash
FLEXOPT_THREADS=4 julia scripts/install_notebook_kernel.jl
```

The committed notebooks expect the default 8-thread kernel. A different thread count can still be selected manually.

## Notebooks outside the repository

A notebook may be stored anywhere. Select the installed flexOPT kernel. If it is launched with another kernel, set the clone location before running the notebook bootstrap:

```julia
ENV["FLEXOPT_ROOT"] = "/absolute/path/to/flexOPT"
```

The project files control package versions; thread count and clone path belong to each user’s local kernelspec and therefore are intentionally not stored in `Project.toml`.
